# Smart-Hacks-Student-Database
This is a simple script based on selenium to scrap the SmartHacks website. The attached csv file is the preliminary test result. The website gives easy access to students email, phone number, city and college, thus making the details public and vulnerable. This is just a security demonstration and strictly meant for educational purposes only.
## Usuage
I will upload a docker image soon. For now simply install the dependencies in venv and run the script.
The webdriver is based on Firefox.

## Contributions
Pull requests are welcomed in optimizing the code. I am not really fluent in python.
