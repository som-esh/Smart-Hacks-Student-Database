# Smart-Hacks-Student-Database
This is a simple script based on selenium to scrap the SmartHacks website. The attached csv file is the preliminary test result. 
## Usuage
I will upload a docker image soon. For now simply install the dependencies in venv and run the script.
The webdriver is based on Firefox.

## Contributions
Pull requests are welcomed in optimizing the code. I am not really fluent in python.
